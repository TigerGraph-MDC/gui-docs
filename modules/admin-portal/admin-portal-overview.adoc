=== Log On 

The Admin Portal and GraphStudio share the same port (14240). If you are logged in one of the servers for your TigerGraph system, you can use `localhost` for your <tigergraph_server_ip_address>. The Admin Portal is on the admin page:

[,http]
----
http://<tigergraph_server_ip_address>:14240/admin/
----

If user authentication has been enabled, users need to log in to access the Admin Portal.

If you are already at GraphStudio, simply click the Admin button image:../../.gitbook/assets/goto_admin_portal.png[] at the right end of the top menu bar.

=== Page Layout

The Admin Portal v3.1 has three pages: Dashboard, Monitor and Management. All the pages share the same Header, Footer, and Navigation Menu.

Choose one single log file by clicking on it, and the content will be shown in the display panel. The title will show the machine id and the path of the opened log file. To the very right, there is a download button  image:download-log-btn.png[]  for downloading the selected log file. Loaded log lines will add to the end of the file (the latest log content) and the system will keep pulling to update the log.

====
Note that it displays up to 32 MB of the log file before the latest line of the chosen log file. If users want to read the entire log file, users need to download the file.

=== Select nodes and provide file path

You can select a specific machine in the cluster to download the output file from. By default, all machines are selected.

After selecting the machine, you need to provide the absolute file path to the file you want to download.
For example: `/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/data/files/v.csv`.

Make sure the file path you provide is allowed by xref:tigergraph-server:security:file-output-policy.adoc[GSQL file output policy].
When a file path is not allowed by the policy, you will not be able to download the file.

=== Preview and download file

Once you provide a valid file path, you will be able to preview and download the file.

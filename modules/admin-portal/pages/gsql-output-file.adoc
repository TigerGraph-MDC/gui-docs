= Download GSQL Output File
:description: Instructions for downloading a GSQL file output from Admin Portal.
:experimental:

In a GSQL query, users can print any output from the query to a file available to download from the Admin Portal.

== Prerequisites
* You are logged in as a user with a role that has all privileges (either the built-in `superuser` role or user-defined role with all privileges).


== Procedure

=== Navigate to GSQL Output File page

In Admin Portal, click btn:[Others] on the left side navigation, and click btn:[GSQL Output File].
After users print the query result into a file, they can preview or download the output files through this page.

=== Select nodes and provide file path

You can select a specific machine in the cluster to download the output file from. By default, all machines are selected.

After selecting the machine, provide the absolute file path to the file you want to download.
For example: `/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/data/files/v.csv`.

Make sure the provided file path is allowed by the xref:tigergraph-server:security:file-output-policy.adoc[GSQL file output policy].
When a file path is not allowed by the policy, you will not be able to preview or download the file.

WARNING: On TigerGraph Cloud, the file output policy is set to only allow file outputs to `/home/tigergraph/gsql_output/` and its subfolders.
This policy cannot be changed on for an TigerGraph Cloud instance for security reasons.

=== Preview and download file

Once you provide a valid file path, you will be able to preview and download the file.

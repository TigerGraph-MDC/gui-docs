= Write Queries

On the Write Queries page, you can write and run custom queries with GSQL.

The Write Query page is horizontally divided into two parts:

* Query Editing Panel
* Result, Log and Visualization Panel

== Query Editing Panel

The Query Editing panel is divided into two sub-panels: the left sub-panel is used to select a query to edit, and the right, larger sub-panel displays the selected query for editing. Here you can edit, save, delete query and/or its draft, install and run the query. The query editor features syntax highlighting customized for the GSQL language.  Also, the query editor performs real-time semantic checking.

Above the query editing pane is a toolbar, with the following buttons, from left to right:

* *Expand/Collapse* : Expand or collapse the Query Editing panel to or from full page mode. The icon changes depending on whether the panel is currently expanded or collapsed.
* *Save* : Save the current query draft.
* *Install* : Install the query into the database.
* *Run* : Run the query. If the query is not installed, it will run the query in interpreted mode. Note there is performance penalty to run queries in interpreted mode.
 ** *Run Configuration:* Set the query runtime configurations.
* *Delete* : Delete the selected query and its draft.
* *Show query endpoint:* Show the RESTFul endpoint to execute the query. Only installed queries can see their RESTFul endpoints.
* *Download:* Download the query as a gsql file.
* *Discard query draft :* Delete the selected query draft.

=== Add Or Edit Query

To create a new query, simply click on the "New GSQL Query" buttonimage:upload_file_btn.png[]at the bottom-right corner of the left sub-panel, and type in the name of the new query in the popup window:

A query draft will be created with a template:

=== Save Query Draft

Once you made some changes to the query code and want to save it as a query draft, click on the "save" buttonimage:save_btn.png[]in the toolbar.

=== Run Query in Interpreted Mode

If you have saved the query and there is no errors in the query, you can run the query in interpreted mode. Click the run query buttonimage:start_loading.png[]. Together with the query execution result, a warning message will appear to notify user of the performance concerns running the query in interpreted mode. To speed up the query performance after you are satisfied with the GSQL query developed in interpreted mode, you can follow the instructions in the next section "Install Query".

=== Install Query

If you saved a query, the "install query" buttonimage:publish_btn.png[]will be enabled. Click it to install the query. The installation process may take about 1 minute:

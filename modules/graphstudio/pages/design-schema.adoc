= Design Schema

== Design Schema
Beginning with Version 3.0, GraphStudio can support modifying multiple graphs within one TigerGraph instance. Read more about Multigraph at xref:3.2@tigergraph-server:intro:multigraph-overview.adoc[MultiGraph - An Overview].

Designing the graph schema is the first and most important step of solving a business problem. The graph schema is the model of the problem, and all of the subsequent steps depend on the graph schema. If you are not on the Design Schema page yet, click "Design Schema" on the left side menu bar.

[CAUTION]
====
Only certain roles have the privilege to modify a graph schema.

. Only the superuser and globaldesigner roles can modify the global graph schema, including creating local graphs.
. Only the superuser, globaldesigner, and designer roles can modify a local graph schema.
====

When there is no graph schema in the system, this page will show some hints:

. Only the superuser and globaldesigner roles can modify the global graph schema, including creating local graphs.
. Only the superuser, globaldesigner, and designer roles modify a local graph schema.

Otherwise this page will visualize the schema:

Each circle represents a vertex type, and each link represents an edge type. You can drag the circles to change their positions. There are two ways to zoom in and out. If you have a touchpad, two-finger moving up zooms in; two-finger moving down zooms out. Similarly, if your mouse has a scroll wheel, spinning forward zooms in, and spinning backward zooms out.

NOTE: The relationship between a vertex type and a vertex instance of a graph is like the relationship between a table and one record of a table in the relational database world. The relationship between an edge type and an edge instance is similar. In the Design Schema step, the user defines vertex types and edge types to model the data schema. After the schema has been created, the next two steps, Map Data To Graph and Load Data, are for loading data into the graph.

=== Global View vs. Graph View

For superuser and globaldesigner, they can modify global vertex and edge types under Global View. Under global view, the toolbar area only contains "Publish schema", "Add a vertex type", "Add an edge type",  "Edit", "Delete", "Undo" and "Redo" buttons. There will be a warning message in the working panel saying user is under global view.

[CAUTION]
====

. If under global view, other pages except Home and Design Schema will be disabled.
. Users other than superuser and globaldesigner cannot access global view.
====

Users can modify a graph schema under graph view. In a graph, there is one more in the toolbar area - "View global vertex and edge types". And for global vertex and edge types used in a graph, a little global icon is attached to them.

= Overview

The TigerGraph GraphStudio™ UI (User Interface) provides an intuitive, browser-based interface that helps users get started quickly with graph-based application development tasks: designing a graph schema, creating a schema mapping, loading data, exploring the graph, and writing GSQL queries. This guide serves as an introduction and quick-start manual for the GraphStudio UI.

== GraphStudio In The Cloud

If you are using GraphStudio in the TigerGraph cloud environment, you can directly access GraphStudio via a browser.

== GraphStudio On-Premises 
For on-premise deployment, the system by default is listening to port 14240. Any machine connected to the server can access GraphStudio from a browser with the following address:

[source,http]
----
http://<your_tigergraph_server_ip_address>:<your_tigergraph_server_port>
----

[NOTE]
====
In v1.2, the default TCP/IP port for GraphStudio has changed from 44240 to 14240, to avoid possible port conflicts with Zookeeper.
====

If you cannot access GraphStudio, check your firewall rules and open 14240 port to public. For example, if your Linux OS uses firewall-cmd:

[source,text]
----
$ firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-port=14240/tcp –permanent
----

If the GraphStudio UI shows some errors at the login page like below, the GUI service might be off.

To verify, in a linux shell of the server, type

 $ gadmin status gui

If it is off, turn it on:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin start gui
----

= Overview

The TigerGraph GraphStudio™ UI (User Interface) provides an intuitive, browser-based interface that helps users get started quickly with graph-based application development tasks: designing a graph schema, creating a schema mapping, loading data, exploring the graph, and writing GSQL queries. This guide serves as an introduction and quick-start manual for the GraphStudio UI.

As of Jan 2020, the GraphStudio UI is certified on following browsers:

|===
| Browser | Chrome | Safari | Firefox | Opera | Edge | Internet Explorer

| Supported version
| 54.0+
| 11.1+
| 59.0+

| 80.0+
| 10+
|===

Not all features are guaranteed to work on other browsers.

== GraphStudio In The Cloud

If you are using GraphStudio in the TigerGraph cloud environment, you can directly access GraphStudio via a browser.

== GraphStudio On-Premises 
For on-premise deployment, the system by default is listening to port 14240. Any machine connected to the server can access GraphStudio from a browser with the following address:

[source,http]
----
http://<your_tigergraph_server_ip_address>:<your_tigergraph_server_port>
----

[NOTE]
====
In v1.2, the default TCP/IP port for GraphStudio has changed from 44240 to 14240, to avoid possible port conflicts with Zookeeper.
====

If you cannot access GraphStudio, check your firewall rules and open 14240 port to public. For example, if your Linux OS uses firewall-cmd:

[source,text]
----
$ firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-port=14240/tcp –permanent
----

If the GraphStudio UI shows some errors at the login page like below, the GUI service might be off.

To verify, in a linux shell of the server, type

 $ gadmin status gui

If it is off, turn it on:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin start gui
----

== Home Page 
The home page of GraphStudio contains links to each of the six steps of
solving a business problem: Design Schema, Map Data To Graph, Load Data,
Explore Graph, Build Graph Patterns and Write Queries. Users can also
navigate to each step from the buttons in the left menu bar. Each of
these major steps has its own page. To hide/show the left menu bar,
click the top-left menu
button:
 image:toggle_nav_bar.png[image] . Clicking
the logo on the top of the left
menu  image:graphstudio-logo-10.22.48-am (2).png[image]  will
take you back to the home page. You can
click  image:goto_admin_portal.png[image] to go to
the Admin Portal (read more at xref:admin-portal:overview.adoc[Admin Portal UI
Guide]).

it uses dark theme. You can click the User
icon  image:account_btn.png[image] and then toggle
the Dark theme to be Off to switch to light theme:

== Switch Between Languages

GraphStudio supports 2 languages: English and Chinese. By default it
uses English. You can
click  image:account_btn.png[image] and then select a
language:

This shows what Home page looks like if you choose Chinese.

== GraphStudio Session Timeout

GraphStudio has a default session timeout of 1 week. If, during this
time, the user has no interaction with the page, the session will expire
and the user will be logged out automatically. The timeout can be
configured with:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin config set GUI.ClientIdleTimeSec [timeout]
----

[[graphstudio-online-test-drive-]]
== GraphStudio Online Test Drive

Visit TigerGraph Test Drive demos at:
https://testdrive.tigergraph.com[https://testdrive.tigergraph.com/]

The GraphStudio online Test Drive features several instances of the
TigerGraph system, each one targeting a different use case. Each copy of
TigerGraph has a GraphStudio interface and is preloaded with
application-specific queries and synthetic data. These demo applications
are provided in a read-only mode. Users can explore and play with
pre-installed queries. Users on these demo systems cannot save changes
to the graph schema, the loading job, or queries. The corresponding
buttons are disabled.

== GraphStudio Limitations

Some features which are available in GSQL are not available in
GraphStudio.

=== xref:design-schema.adoc[]

* Fixed binary data types are not supported.
* PRIMARY KEY and composite key are not supported.

=== xref:map-data-to-graph.adoc[]

* Cannot load JSON data.

=== xref:load-data.adoc[]

* Data loading jobs written in a GSQL console are not shown in
GraphStudio.
* USING options are not available.
* Concurrent loading is not available.

=== xref:write-queries.adoc[]

* You cannot define a user-defined function (you can use the
user-defined functions created from TigerGraph server by importing the
solution which contains pre-defined UDFs into GraphStudio).

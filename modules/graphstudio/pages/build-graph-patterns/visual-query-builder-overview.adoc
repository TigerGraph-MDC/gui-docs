= Visual Query Builder Overview

== Visual Query Builder

In TigerGraph 3.0, we are proudly introducing _Visual Query Builder_ -- a visual way of building your graph business logic. In the Build Graph Patterns page, you can create visual patterns in drag-and-drop fashion, which intuitively represent the questions you want to ask. For these cases, you don't need to write GSQL anymore!

By adding the Visual Query Builder component, GraphStudio becomes a complete visual SDK for users to _build graph applications from end to end without writing a single line of code_!

Currently, Visual Query Builder is still in beta phase. Please expect lots of improvements and changes coming in the future!

=== Basic Concepts

A visual pattern is a declarative way of describing a template subgraph structure, and all the subgraph structures that the visual pattern is *homomorphic* with are valid matching results.

Visual patterns are constructed by vertex patterns, edge patterns and widgets.

This is a basic vertex pattern within a visual pattern:

This is a vertex pattern with 2 filters, 1 aggregation, 2 ordering, and limit:

image::vertex-pattern-full.png[]

This is a vertex pattern that will be output in the pattern execution result. You can see the glow around the border and the highlight at the label:

This is a basic edge pattern:

image::edge-pattern-basic.png[]

This is an edge pattern with 1 filter:

image::edge-pattern-filter.png[]

This is an edge pattern that will be output in the pattern execution result:

image::edge-pattern-filter-output.png[]

This is a union widget:

A widget has input vertex patterns and output vertex patterns:

This is the visual pattern matching all the people who are younger than 30 years old in the year 2019. The filter *((2019 - birthYear) < 30)* on the person vertex pattern provides the matching condition:

This is the visual pattern matching all the departments having at least one male employee:

This is the visual pattern that matches the hometown of the most people having the programming skill. The aggregation *COUNT(DISTINCT p) as cnt* annotates the number of people born in each city that have the programming skill. Then we order the city vertices *by their descending cnt value*, and choose the top 1 city:

This is the visual pattern matching all such three persons A, B and C, where A is B's friend, and A is C's friend, and B is C's manager:

This visual pattern matches all the people that born in Redwood City and attended Stanford university, but didn't work for Google:

Now you have a first sight about how the visual patterns look like. Let's walk through all the concepts in depth.

=== Working Panel

Working panel is the central component (both visually and logically) of Visual Query Builder. Your visual patterns are rendered here.

Like other pages in GraphStudio, you can zoom-in, zoom-out and drag the visual pattern. If you have unsaved changes to the pattern, or containing errors in the pattern, some warning messages will show at the top left corner of working panel:

If you click the message indicating errors, the Console will switch to Problems tab:

You can click the error messages. For some errors, the vertex patterns, edge patterns and widgets involved in the error will be marked red to facilitate your debugging:

=== Pattern List

The pattern list panel contains three sections:
